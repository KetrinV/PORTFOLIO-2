                    This project was made right before christmas and was just something fun, we actually had to do a robot what should have completed some exercises that teachers gave us but it ended up just destroying everything on the table. We also used the lego spike lego set and program for that, it was new and very fun to play with. We had actually several robots made (maybe 5), we made one and then we didn't end up liking it and made it again even more cooler.
                    Here are some robots we did with my classmate:
